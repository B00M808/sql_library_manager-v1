Created an application for my local library to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data manually. The application created provides a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

In this project, I built a web application that includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books.

This project provided a great opportunity to start familiarizing myself with the work of implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence, as well as leveraging helpful database related tools to view and interact with my database.
